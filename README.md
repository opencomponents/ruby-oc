[OpenComponents][6] for Ruby

## Important
This gem is still under heavy development and the API is likely to change at any
time.

## Getting Started
Add the gem to your Gemfile and run `bundle install`:
```ruby
gem 'opencomponents', '~> 0.1.0'
```

By default, the gem will attempt to use a component registry located at
`http://localhost:3030`.
If you want to use a different registry, you can configure OpenComponents to use
it with:
```ruby
OpenComponents.configure { |config| config.registry = 'http://some.other.host' }
```

## Getting Rendered Components
To request an OpenComponent with its rendered HTML, you can create and load a new
`RenderedComponent` object.
```ruby
component = OpenComponents::RenderedComponent.new('my-awesome-component')
component.load
```

Optionally, you can also specify parameters, the component version, and
additional HTTP headers to request:
```ruby
component = OpenComponents::RenderedComponent.new(
  'my-awesome-component',
  params: {name: 'Kate'},
  version: '1.0.2',
  headers: {accept_language: 'emoji'}
)
```

## Getting Pre-rendered Components
If you'd like to perform the component rendering yourself, you can request a
pre-rendered component from a registry using a `PrerenderedComponent` object.
```ruby
component = OpenComponents::PrerenderedComponent.new('my-awesome-component')
component.load
```

You can use the same optional `params`, `version`, and `headers` arguments as
`RenderedComponent`s.

**Note**: `PrerenderedComponent`s will only fetch component data for you - they
do not provide an interface for rendering them. At the moment, it's up to you to
determine the best way to render the template.

## Integrations
Individual integrations for rendering components in Rails and Sinatra are
available.
